# Odd and Even Elements
- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, we are @wizardogrammer, what a fantastic day!

This program gets a vector in range 20 and arranges them to first odd indices then even indices next to each other :)

`Input:` Enter 20 integers.

`Output:` The same list with odd numbers first.


## Example

`Input:` [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]

`Output:` [1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10]
