# Sum of Positives
- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, we are @wizardogrammer, what a fantastic day!

This program gets a vector in range 20 and arrange them to first odd indices then even indices next to each other :)

`Input:` Enter your desired size of the list.

`Second Input:` Enter the integer elements you want in the list one by one and then hit Enter.

`Output:` The summation of positive numbers.

## Example

`Input:` 5

`Second Input:` 

                12

                -15 

                35 

                -60 

                -70

`Output:` Final solution = 47
