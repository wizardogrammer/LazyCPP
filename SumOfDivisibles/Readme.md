# Sum of Divisibles
- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, hope you have a fantastic day, we are @wizardogrammer

In this tutorial we show how you check a list if it contains numbers divisble by 5 and not by 7? Then print the summation of them.

`Input`: Enter your desired size of the list.

`Second Input`: Enter the integer elements you want in the list one by one and then hit Enter.

`Output`: The summation of numbers divisible by 5 and not by 7.

## Example

`Input`: 5

`Second Input`: 

                12

                15 

                35 

                60 

                70

`Output`: 15 + 60 = 75
