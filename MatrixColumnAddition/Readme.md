# Matrix Column Addition
- 👋 Hi, we are @wizardogrammer, what a fantastic day!

This program gets a 2 dimension matrix with given row and column and adds the elements the each column and push them to a new vector :-)

## Example

`Input:` 3 for row

`Input:` 3 for column

`Input:` [[1, 2, 3],
          [2, 3, 1],
          [3, 2, 1]]


`Output:` [6, 7, 5]
